# To-Do-List
[Javascript - To-Do List Project - The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/node-path-javascript-todo-list)

The purpose of this project was to build a simple To-Do List web application using ES6 modules, webpack, and localStorage. Overall, I learned a lot about how to utilize ES6 Classes to compartmentalize my project functions and how to use localStorage to save/edit user data.
